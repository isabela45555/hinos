<h2>Letra do Hino</h2>
<p>
Oh, say, can you see<br>
By the dawn's early light<br>
What so proudly we hailedv<br>
At the twilight's last gleaming?<br>
Whose broad stripes and bright stars<br>
Through the perilous fight<br>
O'er the ramparts we watched<br>
Were so gallantly streaming?<br>
And the rockets red glare<br>
The bombs bursting in air<br>
Gave proof through the night<br>
That our flag was still there<br>
Oh, say, does that star-spangled banner yet wave<br>
O'er the land of the free<br>
And the home of the brave?<br>
On the shore, dimly seen<br>
Through the mists of the deep<br>
Where the foe's haughty host<br>
In dread silence reposes<br>
What is that which the breeze<br>
O'er the towering steep<br>
As it fitfully blows<br>
Half conceals, half discloses?<br>
Now it catches the gleam<br>
Of the morning's first beam<br>
In fully glory reflected<br>
Now shines on the stream<br>
'Tis the star-spangled banner<br>
Oh, long may it wave<br>
O'er the land of the free<br>
And the home of the brave<br>
When our land is illumined<br>
With Liberty's smile<br>
If a foe from within<br>
Strike a blow at her glory<br>
Down, down with the traitor<br>
That dares to defile<br>
The flag of her stars<br>
And the page of her story<br>
By the millions unchained<br>
Who our birthright have gained<br>
We will keep her bright blazon<br>
Forever unstained<br>
And the star-spangled banner<br>
In triumph shall wave<br>
While the land of the free<br>
Is the home of the brave<br>
Oh, thus be it ever<br>
When freemen shall stand<br>
Between their loved home<br>
And the war's desolation<br>
Blest with victory and peace<br>
May the heaven-rescued land<br>
Praise the Power that has made<br>
And preserved us a nation<br>
Then conquer we must<br>
When our cause it is just<br>
And this be our motto: In God is our trust<br>
And the star-spangled banner<br>
In triumph shall wave<br>
O'er the land of the free<br>
And the home of the brave<br>
